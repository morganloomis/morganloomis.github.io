Hello, welcome to my website. I’ve been working as an animator and rigger in the visual effects industry since 2005. My family and I live in New Zealand.

### More Information

I’m always looking for ways to improve animation workflow and pipeline, and I enjoy scripting almost as much as animating. I’ve learned a lot over the years from people selflessly sharing their knowledge and tools, and hopefully this site will be a way to give a little bit back to our awesome community.

Feel free to drop me a line if you have any questions or comments.
