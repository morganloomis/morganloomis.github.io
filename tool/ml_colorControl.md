## Description

 Color selections of nodes as a gradient. Choose a first and last color, and the intermediate colors will be generated by offsetting hsv.

## Installation

Copy this file into your maya scripts directory, for example:

`C:/Documents and Settings/user/My Documents/maya/scripts/ml_colorControl.py`

Run the tool in a python shell or shelf button by importing the module, 
and then calling the primary function:

```python
import ml_colorControl
ml_colorControl.ui()
```

## Usage

 Set the first and last color using the swatch. Select nodes in the order that you want the gradient to run. Finally press the "Color Selected Nodes" button. If you can't decide on a color, try a random one.

## Requirements

 This script requires the ml_utilities module, which can be downloaded here: http://morganloomis.com/wiki/tools.html#ml_utilities
