## Installation

Copy this file into your maya scripts directory, for example:

`C:/Documents and Settings/user/My Documents/maya/scripts/ml_toggleVisibility.py`

Run the tool in a python shell or shelf button by importing the module, 
and then calling the primary function:

```python
import ml_toggleVisibility
ml_toggleVisibility.main()
```

## Usage

 Select an object, and run the script. If the object is visible, it will be hidden, and vice-versa.
