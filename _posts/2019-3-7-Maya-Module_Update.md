title: Maya Module Update
---


The tool suite has been restructured to support the Maya Module system, which should hopefully make it easier to install the whole thing if you clone the github repository. See the [README](https://github.com/morganloomis/ml_tools/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on how to add a module to maya. (Thanks to [Tim](https://github.com/timlehr) for doing the heavy lifting)
